# Welcome to the Quantum Computing Workbook!

This website is a introductory resource for those wishing to learn quantum computing and programming through a hands-on approach. Almost no prior knowledge regarding quantum mechanics and computational science is required. Anyone with an understanding of first-year university mathematics and some Python programming experience should be able to work through the tutorials in this website and learn quantum computing on their own, starting from zero.

This workbook is also a supplementary instructional material for an introductory quantum computing course at the University of Tokyo (*Quantum computer training using IBM-Q: Learn with both hardware and software*), offered by [Quantum Native Education Center](http://qnec.jp/) (website in Japanese only). The chapters of the workbook correspond to individual class sessions, and there are assignment problems at the end of each chapter.

Throughout this workbook, you will be writing Python programs using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) and running quantum circuits on [IBM Quantum](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com) (IBMQ) computers. You will need an IBMid account to use IBMQ (Please reference the {doc}`Prerequisites <prerequisites>` section).

## About the authors

This workbook is written entirely by researchers at the [International Center for Elementary Particle Physics (ICEPP)](http://www.icepp.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) at [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html). While we are interested in quantum computation research itself, our greater research emphasys is in the use of quantum computers to advance science and technology. For this reason, the topics dealt within this workbook, and the order in which they are covered, differs somewhat from a typical beginner's guide to quantum computing. For those who (additionally) want a more conventional and systematic introduction to quantum computation, we recommend checking out other high-quality guides listed in the {doc}`Bibliography <bibliography>`.
